        <h2>HTML paragraphs are defined with the "p" tag:</h2>
        <p>This is paragraph</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph</p>

        <h1>HTML Display::</h1>
        <h3>You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. <br>

            Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. <br>
            
            With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code. <br>
            
            The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
            
            </h3>
            <p>
                This paragraph
              contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser

            <h1>HTML Horizontal Rules::</h1>
            <h3>The "hr" tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. <br>

                The "hr" element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
                
                </h3>
                <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
<p>The "hr" tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.</p>
<h1>HTML Line Breaks::</h1>
<h3>The HTML "br" element defines a line break. <br>

    Use "br" if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:</h3>

    <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
    <h3>The "br" tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.</h3>

    <h1>The Poem Problem::</h1>
    <h2>This poem will display on a single line:</h2>
    <p>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
      
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
      
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
      </p>
      <h1>Solution - The HTML "pre" Element ::
    </h1>
    <h2>The HTML "pre" element defines preformatted text. <br>

        The text inside a "pre" element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:</h2>
    <pre>
        
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>
